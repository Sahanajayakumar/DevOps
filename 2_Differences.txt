1.)What is the difference Between Main Branch and Master Branch?

main or master is default branch when you create a repository. GitHub uses main as its default branch while others systems still use master.

2.)Can you explain the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git: Git is a version control system that allows developers to manage changes to their code. GIT will allow installing it on your local system.

GitHub: GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. With GitHub, developers can store their code remotely and collaborate with others on the same codebase. Additionally, GitHub provides a web-based interface for viewing and managing code, as well as several additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis.

3.)What is the difference between local & remote repositories? How to connect local to remote?

The local repository is a Git repository that is stored on your computer. Local repositories reside on the computers of team members.

The remote repository is a Git repository that is stored on some remote computer. In contrast, remote repositories are hosted on a server that is accessible for all team members - most likely on the internet.
